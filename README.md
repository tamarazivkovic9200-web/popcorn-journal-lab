## My app title: ***Popcorn Journal***
is a full-stack CRUD web app that lets users track their favorite ***Movies*** and ***TV Shows***.  
You can add, edit, delete, and review shows in your personal watchlist.

### My goal for this app is to create an app where users can:
- Add movies and TV shows to ther watch list
- Mark them as watched or to watch
- View all ther Movies/TV shows in one dashbord
